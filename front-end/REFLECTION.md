when the relation is one to many, the logic is easier to move forward, with the practice exercise, indeed it helps on the flow
The many to many relation make me confuse sometimes, I have to break it down to bullet plan to achieve it step by step. during this relation, I also find difficult to understand the question sometimes.
During coding, I always have the feeling of I feel familar with question, I knew how to do it, but by the time get on hand, it often stuck with the format, or typo.In general, more exercise will help on more fluent flow.
My logic effect the code flow, when my logic mess up, the flow also mess up without logic. I cannot jump over the logic but need to do it flow by flow.
