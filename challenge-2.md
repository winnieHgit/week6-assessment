# Final assessment: üìö Book club

## A big assessment

In this assessment we will test you on everything we learned the past weeks. This is a large project and you need to make sure you are in your best shape!

- **You better check yo' self before you wreck yo' self**

  - üõ°Ô∏è Make a battleplan.
  - ü¶Ü Get a rubber duck (or a partner, or a plant, just something that doesn't mind when you talk to it). **This really works!**
  - üõèÔ∏è Make sure to get enough sleep, and drink and eat enough to keep your energy stable.
  - üå≥ Take a walk by yourself if you are stuck.

- **Read the whole document before you start!**

  - This assessment has a different scoring system than our other assessments. A good strategy is to prioritise the features that are easiest and end with the ones that will be the hardest.
    - Some features are dependent on other features, those will be hard to skip.
    - You can find the exact amount of points you can score per feature at the end of this document.
  - This assessment requires you to commit often and include meaningfull commit messages.
  - There is also a required self-reflection you will have to write.

- **If you have problems that have nothing to do with coding, contact a teacher**

  - We can't answer every question, but there is a chance that an error is not your fault. At that point we might be able to help you.

## What are we building?

We are building a web app where users can track their progress in reading books, and share that information with other users. It's called `Book Club`.

The site has multiple pages:

- `/register` to register as a user
- `/login` to log in as a registered user
- `/` a homepage that shows a list of all the books in the system
- `/book/[bookId]` where everyone can see all the stats of a single book
- `/progress` where the logged-in user can see their progress for all their books

### ‚ùóÔ∏è 3.1 Auth pages

**User story**: _As a user, I want to be able to register for an account and use that account to log in so that I can see and manage my progress on books_

In your front-end project, add two new pages.

- `/register` should show a form that allows the user to register to the application. The data in the form should be validated and the user should receive feedback if any validation error happens.
- The validation for creating a user:
  - `username` should have a minimum length of 5 characters
  - `password` should have a minimum length of 10 characters
- `/login` should show a form that allows the user to log in, the resulting token should be stored in LocalStorage.

| Part               | Goal                                                                                                     | Points | Total |

### ‚ùóÔ∏è 3.3 Homepage

**User story**: _As a user, I want to see a list of all the books available on the site so that I can decide what to read_

**User story**: _As a user, I want to be able to sort the list of books alphabetically so I can quickly find a book_

**User story**: _As a user, I want to see be able to sort the list of books by the number of users currently reading it so I can see which books are popular_

- The `/` (home)page should display a list of all available books
- The books should come from the API endpoint `GET /books`
- By default, Books should be ordered alphabetically by their name
- There are two buttons on the page: `Sort by name` and `Sort by popularity`.
  - When `Sort by name` is clicked, the books should be sorted by name
  - When `Sort by popularity` is clicked, the books should by sorted the amount of BookProgresses objects are connected to it. (It doesn't matter what the value of `pageProgress` is)
- Clicking on an book's name redirects to `/books/[bookId]`
- Books are displayed with the number of BookProgresses they have in the database and their name

#### On the Backend

There needs to be an endpoint `GET /books` that returns the necessary information.

| Part             | Goal                                                                               | Points | Total |

  - title
  - The cover image of the book (get it from `coverImageUrl`)
  - The author
  - The pageCount
  - The amount of BookProgresses that are in the database and belong to this book
  - The average `pageProgress` for this book. To calculate this:
    - Get all the BookProgress objects associated with this book, sum their `pageProgress` values and divide by the number of BookProgress objects

#### On the Backend

There needs to be an endpoint `GET /books/:book_id` endpoint that returns the necessary information.

| Part                      | Goal                                                                      | Points | Total |

### ‚ùóÔ∏è 3.5 Create a BookProgress

**User story**: _As a user, I want to be able to start tracking my progress on a book_

- There's a button on the `/books/[bookdId] page that says 'Start reading book'.
- This button is only shown if the user is logged in
- Clicking the button should create a new BookProgress in the database, with the correct `userId` and `bookId`.
- The new BookProgress should be created with `pageProgress` equal to `0`

#### On the Backend

There needs to be an endpoint `POST /bookprogress` endpoint that creates a new BookProgress object in the database and uses authentication to determine the `userId`

| Part                          | Goal                                                                                                                 | Points | Total |

### ‚ùóÔ∏è 3.6 The Progress Page

**User story**: _As a user I want to see an overview of all the books I'm reading so I can get an idea of my progress_

- The `/progress` page shows a list of all the books that have a BookProgress by the logged in user
- Every book shows the amount of pages the user has read and the total amount of pages in the book (something like: `50/230 pages read`)
- The page can only be seen if the user is logged in
  - If a user is not logged in and navigates to this page, one of the following should happen:
    - The user is redirected to `/login`
    - The user sees an error message, something like: `Login to see your progress` or `You are not authorized`, for example.

#### On the Backend

There needs to be an endpoint `GET /my-progress` that uses authentication to get all the books the user has a BookProgress for.

| Part                      | Goal                                                                                          | Points | Total |

### ‚ùóÔ∏è 3.7 Modify Progress Form

**User story**: _As a user I want to be able to modify the progress for a specific book so that I can track my progress_

- Every book on the `/progress` page should have a form that allows the user to modify the `pageProgress` for that specific book.
- There is no requirement for how the form looks like, it can be a textbox, slider, etc..
- There should be a button to submit the new `pageProgress`.

#### On the Backend

There needs to be an endpoint `PATCH /bookprogress/:id` that uses authentication to modify the `pageProgress` of that BookProgress object. This endpoint will need additional validation described in the next feature.

| Part                          | Goal                                                                                         | Points | Total |

### ‚ùóÔ∏è 3.8 Backend BookProgress validation

**User story**: _As a user I want the application to check if my progress is valid so that there is no chance I create an invalid progress_

- The `PATCH /bookprogress/:id` endpoint should check if the new `pageProgress` value is a valid one.
  - The pageProgress can't be higher than the associated book's `pageCount` value.

| Part                                    | Goal                                                                                                                                      | Points | Total |
